# HiTRACE (High Throughput Robust Analysis of Capillary Electrophoresis)


**HiTRACE** is a collection of *MATLAB* scripts to automate the key tasks in large-scale nucleic acid CE analysis, including the profile alignment that has heretofore been a rate-limiting step in the highest throughput experiments. It has been intensively used for quantitating data for RNA and DNA based on the mutate-and-map methodology, chromatin footprinting, and other high-throughput structure mapping techniques.

An online user-friendly GUI is available at the [**HiTRACE Web**](http://hitrace.org/).

## Installation

**HiTRACE** requires *MATLAB* version `>= R2011a` and `<= R2014a`. Later versions of *MATLAB* are incompatible with codes that involves interactive interface handling.

To install **HiTRACE**, simply:

- Download the zip or tar file of the repository and unpack; or `git clone https://github.com/hitrace/hitrace.git`.

- In *MATLAB*, go to "**Set Path**". Then "**Add with Subfolders**" of the target `path/to/hitrace/Scripts/`.

## Usage 

*MATLAB* Tutorial is available at https://daslab.github.io/hitrace/.
